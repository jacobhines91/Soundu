# Background
	Most music applications available today only displays music or provide videos of your favorite artist’s work. Here with our application Soundu, we are spearheading a whole new viewing and searching experience. Soundu is a web based service that allows for the search of different artists and for the seamless visualization of their videos. Our target audience is any individual who holds a passion for music and has a desire for a more streamlined searching and viewing experience. 

Objectives
·        To provide an easy to use application that allows for users to search for favorite artists and 
and providing said artist’s information to the user. 
·         Optimizing the use of two separate API’s to call information such as artist’s top
viewed video, tour dates, and latest news of said artist as well. 
·         Populate/suggest other artists that are similar in genre to the artist that is being searched. 

Scope
The primary goal of the project is to design and build an application that pulls from the Spo and Youtube API to populate information onto the Soundu service. Videos, information and other suggested artists based on genre will be displayed on the page.
